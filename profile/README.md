## Roadmap
- Current goal: finish [fc-hosting](https://github.com/FerretCode-Freelancing/fc-hosting)
- Next, we plan on waiting for a while to see how the project does, perform any necessary changes or fixes, and introduce some new features like integrated databases into user environments.
- After that, we're looking at implementing a CI/CD platform as well for [fc-hosting](https://github.com/FerretCode-Freelancing/fc-hosting)
